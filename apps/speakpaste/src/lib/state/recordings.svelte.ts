/**
 * Reactive recording state backed by Yjs workspace tables.
 *
 * Replaces TanStack Query + BlobStore for recording CRUD. SvelteMap provides
 * per-key reactivity—updating one recording doesn't re-render the entire list.
 * The Yjs observer fires on local writes, remote CRDT sync, and migration.
 *
 * Audio blob access still goes through BlobStore (blobs are too large for CRDTs).
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { recordings } from '$lib/state/recordings.svelte';
 *
 * // Read reactively (re-renders on change)
 * const recording = recordings.get(id);
 * const all = recordings.sorted; // newest first
 *
 * // Write (Yjs observer auto-updates SvelteMap → components re-render)
 * recordings.set(recording);
 * recordings.delete(id);
 * ```
