 * Recording management actions. These are UI-boundary functions that compose

 *
 * Unlike the lifecycle commands in `actions.ts` (start/stop/cancel recording),
 * these handle recording management—operations users perform on existing recordings.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Single delete from any component
 * recordingActions.deleteWithConfirmation(recording);
 *
 * // Bulk delete
 * recordingActions.deleteWithConfirmation(selectedRecordings);
 *
 * // With callback (e.g., close a modal after deletion)
 * recordingActions.deleteWithConfirmation(recording, {
 *   onSuccess: () => { isDialogOpen = false; },
 * });
 * ```

	 *
	 * Composes: confirmation dialog → audio URL cleanup → workspace delete → notification.
	 * Workspace deletes are synchronous fire-and-forget (Yjs write). Audio URLs are
	 * revoked before delete to prevent memory leaks.
	 *
	 * @param toDelete - Single recording or array of recordings to delete
	 * @param options.onSuccess - Called after successful deletion (e.g., close a modal)
