# `attachSync` Supervisor Evolution: State Machine, Cross-Tab Sync, Goodbye Frame, Internal Events

**Date**: 2026-04-30
**Status**: Draft
**Author**: AI-assisted
**Branch**: supervisor-abortsignal (current) -> supervisor-v2 (proposed)

## Overview

Three product changes and one internal testing primitive for `attachSync` (`packages/workspace/src/document/attach-sync.ts`) that build on the recent `AbortController` refactor (commit `d170d7ba7`): replace the implicit state machine with an explicit reducer plus effects model (A1), make browser cross-tab sync automatic through Web Locks plus BroadcastChannel (A2), introduce a tiny `MESSAGE_TYPE.GOODBYE` wire frame for graceful disconnects (A4), and keep the async event bus internal until a real public consumer appears (A3). The recommended landing order is A4 -> A1 -> A2, with A3 implemented only as private test/debug infrastructure during A1.

## Motivation

### Current State

After the `AbortController` refactor, `attachSync` is structurally clean but still composed of mutable state scattered across the closure:

```typescript
let permanentFailure: SyncFailedReason | null = null;
const masterController = new AbortController();
let cycleController: AbortController = childOf(masterController.signal);
let websocket: WebSocket | null = null;
let loopPromise: Promise<void> | null = null;
let localVersion = 0;
let ackedVersion = 0;
let syncStatusTimer: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null = null;
const pendingRequests = new Map<...>();
let nextRequestId = 0;
const status = createStatusEmitter<SyncStatus>({ phase: 'offline' });
```

(`packages/workspace/src/document/attach-sync.ts:468-551`)

The supervisor (`runLoop`) drives transitions through these by mutating in line, then nudging `status.set(...)` to broadcast the externally-visible phase. There are at least three implicit invariants the reader must hold in their head:

- `websocket !== null` iff the loop is in `attemptConnection` past the `ws.onopen` line and before `ws.onclose`.
- `loopPromise !== null` iff the supervisor is running a cycle.
- `permanentFailure !== null` blocks `runLoop`'s `while`, but `reconnect()` clears it back to `null` to allow recovery.

This creates problems:

1. **Implicit state machine, hard to reason about.** Six observable states (offline, connecting, handshaking, connected, backing_off, failed) and ~10 events (start, stop, token result, ws open/close/error, handshake complete, backoff done, status tick) are tangled into a single async loop. The "reconnect-during-supervisor-tail" race at `attach-sync.ts:944-955` is a comment-heavy patch over a structural gap. New contributors cannot easily answer "what happens if X arrives in state Y."
2. **No internal event stream.** Tests and debug tooling that need ordered transitions, wire bytes, peer joins/leaves, or RPC observations get one callback per concern (`onStatusChange`, `observe`). An integration test that asserts a sequence ("connecting -> connected -> hasLocalChanges:true -> hasLocalChanges:false") needs a custom queue. That is a real internal smell, but it does not yet justify a public `sync.events()` API.
3. **Server cannot tell graceful from network drop.** Both `goOffline()` and `doc.destroy()` call `ws.close()` which the server sees as code 1006 (abnormal close), indistinguishable from a TCP drop. The DO has to wait out the awareness 30s TTL and reply `RpcError.PeerOffline` to in-flight RPCs that could have been answered with "we know they intentionally left."
4. **N tabs = N WebSockets to the same DO.** A user with 12 workspace tabs opens 12 sockets, runs 12 ping loops, and shows up in awareness 12 times under the same `deviceId`. Same is true on devices with multiple PWA windows. CRDTs make this *correct*, just wasteful.

### Code Smell Test

The smell test is whether the caller has to know about sync topology. If a caller has to wire persistence, cross-tab broadcast, the socket, and a future leader-election flag in the right order, the abstraction is leaking.

Current browser workspace setup:

```typescript
const idb = attachIndexedDb(doc.ydoc);
attachBroadcastChannel(doc.ydoc);

const sync = attachSync(doc, {
  url: toWsUrl(`${APP_URLS.API}/workspaces/${doc.ydoc.guid}`),
  waitFor: idb,
  device,
  getToken: () => auth.getToken(),
});
```

Bad redesigned API:

```typescript
const idb = attachIndexedDb(doc.ydoc);
attachBroadcastChannel(doc.ydoc);

const sync = attachSync(doc, {
  url,
  waitFor: idb,
  device,
  getToken,
  leaderElection: true,
});
```

This is worse than today. The caller now knows two implementation details: same-tab docs need BroadcastChannel and browser tabs need leader election. The fact that those two mechanisms must cooperate is exactly what `attachSync` should hide.

Target browser call site:

```typescript
const idb = attachIndexedDb(doc.ydoc);

const sync = attachSync(doc, {
  url,
  waitFor: idb,
  device,
  getToken,
});
```

Direct transport remains available only for unusual cases:

```typescript
const sync = attachSync(doc, {
  url,
  waitFor: idb,
  crossTab: 'direct',
});
```

Internal smell before A1:

```typescript
let permanentFailure: SyncFailedReason | null = null;
let websocket: WebSocket | null = null;
let loopPromise: Promise<void> | null = null;

async function runLoop(signal: AbortSignal) {
  while (!signal.aborted && !permanentFailure) {
    status.set({ phase: 'connecting', retries: backoff.retries });
    const result = await attemptConnection(token, signal);
    if (result === 'connected') backoff.reset();
    await backoff.sleep(signal);
  }
}
```

Better shape after A1:

```typescript
const { state, effects } = step(current, event);
current = state;
for (const effect of effects) runEffect(effect);
```

A1 earns its keep because A2 adds another mode. Without an explicit state machine, the leader/follower split will pile more lifecycle branches onto the existing supervisor closure.

Public API smell for A3:

```typescript
for await (const event of sync.events({ types: ['wire-in', 'rpc-request'] })) {
  debug(event);
}
```

That looks useful, but it exposes wire vocabulary as public API. Once shipped, `wire-in`, `rpc-request`, and payload shapes become compatibility promises. Keep this private first:

```typescript
const events = createSyncEventBus();
runtime.onEvent((event) => events.emit(event));
```

### Desired State

```typescript
// A1: explicit FSM, no hidden mutation
const machine = createSupervisorMachine({ url, getToken, ... });
machine.send({ type: 'START' });

// A3: internal event stream for tests and debug tooling
const events = createSyncEventBus();
events.emit({ type: 'status', status: sync.status });

// A4: graceful disconnect
sync.goOffline();   // sends GOODBYE(reason: 'user_request') before ws.close()

// A2: browser cross-tab sharing is automatic
attachSync(doc, { url, waitFor: idb });
// First browser tab acquires Web Lock + WebSocket; others piggyback via BC.
// Node, workers, and unsupported browsers fall back to a direct WebSocket.
```

## Research Findings

### Comparison: y-websocket reference vs current `attachSync`

Grounded against `yjs/y-websocket` and `yjs/y-protocols` via deepwiki.

| Concern | `y-websocket` (upstream) | Current `attachSync` | Post-spec target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reconnect | `setTimeout` recursion + `shouldConnect` flag | `AbortController` hierarchy | FSM with explicit `START`/`STOP` events |
| Backoff | 100ms x 2^n, cap 2.5s, no jitter | 500ms x 2^n, cap 30s, jitter 0.5-1.0x | unchanged (already strong) |
| Liveness | 30s no-message threshold, no active ping | 90s threshold + 60s `'ping'` text (CF auto-pongs) | unchanged |
| Status API | events: `status`, `sync`, `connection-close` | typed `SyncStatus` discriminated union | unchanged publicly; internal event bus for tests/debug |
| `whenSynced` | none | `whenConnected` Promise (resolves on STEP2/UPDATE, rejects on dispose/4401) | unchanged |
| Persistence gate | none | `waitFor: idb.whenLoaded` | unchanged |
| Permanent failure | none, retries forever | close 4401 -> terminal `failed` phase | becomes a state, not a flag (A1) |
| Auth | URL params or in-protocol AUTH frame | `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bearer.<token>` | unchanged |
| Graceful disconnect | none | none | new `MESSAGE_TYPE.GOODBYE` (A4) |
| Cross-tab BC | built into provider | separate `attachBroadcastChannel` | automatic browser cross-tab sharing inside `attachSync` (A2) |

**Key finding**: `attachSync` is already significantly more sophisticated than `y-websocket` on every axis. The pieces missing are not on the upstream roadmap (XState-style machines, leader election, goodbye frames are all custom-territory). No upstream pattern to inherit; we are designing.

### State machine libraries vs hand-rolled

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| XState | Visualizable, well-known mental model, dev tools | New runtime dep (~25KB min+gz), team has no XState elsewhere, bundle cost for browser apps |
| Zag.js | Smaller than XState, framework-agnostic | Same "new dep" issue |
| Hand-rolled reducer | Zero deps, matches codebase style | We write all the test scaffolding ourselves |

**Recommendation**: Hand-rolled. The state space is small (6 states, ~10 events) and the codebase has no precedent for state-chart libraries. We can borrow the *vocabulary* (states, events, effects) without adopting any library.

### Web Locks API support

`navigator.locks` is supported in all modern browsers (Chrome 69+, Firefox 96+, Safari 15.4+). It's NOT available in:

- Service Workers (we don't run there)
- Cloudflare Workers / Node (we run via `attachSync` only in browsers and Node servers; in Node, leader election is meaningless because each process has its own ydoc)
- Old WebView shells (Tauri's WebKit is recent enough)

Lock semantics (per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Locks_API)):
- `navigator.locks.request(name, callback)` blocks the callback until the lock is available, runs it, releases on resolve/reject.
- Locks are scoped to origin + lock name; they survive tab navigation but die with the tab.
- The `steal: true` option forcibly takes a lock from another holder (useful for crash recovery, but we don't need it).

**Implication**: leader election is a clean fit. The lock holder runs the WebSocket; others wait inside `request()`'s callback queue. When the leader tab dies (or navigates away), the lock auto-releases, the next waiting tab's callback runs.

### Async iterator patterns

Three common patterns in the wild:

| Pattern | Used by | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Single shared queue, fanout to listeners | `events.on` | Easy; can't filter per-listener |
| Per-iterator queue, demand-driven | RxJS Subjects, Node streams | More code; per-iterator filtering & backpressure |
| Generator with `yield` from inside the loop | Some Yjs internals | Tightly couples producer to consumer count |

**Recommendation**: per-iterator queue. Trivial to filter, multiple iterators get independent buffers, `iterator.return()` cleans up subscription on `break` / early exit.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| State machine implementation | Hand-rolled reducer + effects queue | No suitable lib in repo; state space small; matches codebase style |
| State machine: where effects run | Separate `effectRunner` module | Keeps reducer pure; effects are testable in isolation; matches Elm/MVU pattern |
| FSM: replace `permanentFailure` flag | `state.phase === 'failed'` | One source of truth; impossible-state by construction |
| Event API: public shape | Deferred | No current consumer justifies freezing wire/debug vocabulary as API |
| Event API: internal shape | `createSyncEventBus()` | Gives tests ordered observations without exposing internals |
| Event API: backpressure | Buffered queue per iterator, no producer slowdown | Wire is real-time; we cannot pause ws.onmessage |
| Goodbye frame: message type | `102` in the Epicenter range (100+) | 102 is next free after RPC=101 |
| Goodbye frame: payload | `[varuint: 102] [varuint: reason_code]` | Symmetric with SYNC_STATUS; tiny on wire |
| Goodbye reasons | `0=unknown, 1=user_request, 2=doc_destroyed` | Minimal vocabulary; extensible via reserved range |
| Goodbye: where to send | Both `goOffline()` and dispose path, before `ws.close()` | Server uses the reason for telemetry + RPC PeerOffline routing |
| Cross-tab mode | `crossTab?: 'auto' | 'direct'`, default `'auto'` | Browser callers get one socket per doc by default; escape hatch remains explicit |
| Leader election: lock name | `epicenter:sync:${ydoc.guid}` | Per-doc; avoids cross-doc contention |
| Leader election: follower writes | Routed to leader via internal BroadcastChannel | Reuses existing document update channel semantics without caller wiring |
| Leader election: follower RPC | Routed to leader via new BC message type | Required because RPC needs request/response correlation |
| Leader election: awareness | Leader owns; followers publish state via BC, leader merges | Single source of truth on the wire |
| Backwards compatibility | A1 and A4 are internal or additive; A2 changes browser defaults | Migration removes explicit browser `attachBroadcastChannel` calls where `attachSync` is present |
| Bundle impact | Hand-rolled, no new deps | Net code addition: ~600 lines; no new bundle deps |

## Architecture

### A1: Explicit Supervisor State Machine

Replace the implicit state machine in `runLoop` with an explicit reducer.

```

        │       ▼
        │ ┌─────────┐
        └─│ failed  │   (terminal; only START exits via clearing reason)
          └─────────┘
```

**File: `packages/workspace/src/document/sync-machine.ts` (new)**

```typescript
// State (discriminated union; impossible states impossible)
export type MachineState =
  | { phase: 'offline' }
  | { phase: 'connecting'; retries: number; lastError?: SyncError }
  | { phase: 'handshaking'; ws: WebSocket; retries: number }
  | { phase: 'connected'; ws: WebSocket; hasLocalChanges: boolean }
  | { phase: 'backing_off'; retries: number; lastError?: SyncError }
  | { phase: 'failed'; reason: SyncFailedReason };

// Events (everything that can move the machine)
export type MachineEvent =
  | { type: 'START' }
  | { type: 'STOP'; reason: 'goOffline' | 'reconnect' | 'destroy' }
  | { type: 'CONNECT_ATTEMPT' }
  | { type: 'TOKEN_OBTAINED'; token: string | null }
  | { type: 'TOKEN_REJECTED'; error: unknown }
  | { type: 'WS_OPEN'; ws: WebSocket }
  | { type: 'HANDSHAKE_COMPLETE' }
  | { type: 'WS_CLOSE'; code: number; reason: string }
  | { type: 'BACKOFF_DONE' }
  | { type: 'LOCAL_CHANGES'; hasLocalChanges: boolean };

// Effects (commands the runtime executes)
export type MachineEffect =
  | { type: 'OPEN_WS'; url: string; subprotocols: string[] }
  | { type: 'CLOSE_WS'; ws: WebSocket; goodbyeReason?: GoodbyeReason }
  | { type: 'GET_TOKEN' }
  | { type: 'START_BACKOFF'; retries: number }
  | { type: 'CANCEL_BACKOFF' }
  | { type: 'EMIT'; event: SyncEvent };  // for A3 iterator

// Reducer (pure)
export function step(
  state: MachineState,
  event: MachineEvent,
): { state: MachineState; effects: MachineEffect[] };
```

**File: `packages/workspace/src/document/sync-runtime.ts` (new)**

Owns the side-effect runner: WebSocket lifecycle, backoff timers, token fetching, abort signal threading. Calls `step()` on each event, processes returned effects.

**File: `packages/workspace/src/document/attach-sync.ts` (modified)**

Becomes a thin wrapper: builds the dispatch tree, constructs awareness, instantiates the machine + runtime, exposes the `SyncAttachment` surface. Body shrinks from ~1290 lines to ~600.

### A3: Internal Async Iterator Event Bus

   iterator A           iterator B           iterator C
   filter:status        filter:rpc-*         filter:all

     console.log         it.next()             debugPanel.push(ev)
   }                                         }
```

This is not a public `SyncAttachment` method in the first implementation. It is private infrastructure used by reducer/runtime tests, debug panels inside this repo, and future diagnostics. Public exposure is deferred until a concrete app needs it.

**Internal SyncEvent variants:**

```typescript
export type SyncEvent =
  | { type: 'status'; status: SyncStatus }
  | { type: 'wire-in'; bytes: Uint8Array; messageType: number }
  | { type: 'wire-out'; bytes: Uint8Array; messageType: number }
  | { type: 'rpc-request'; rpc: DecodedRpcRequest }
  | { type: 'rpc-response'; rpc: DecodedRpcResponse }
  | { type: 'peer-joined'; clientId: number; state: PeerAwarenessState }
  | { type: 'peer-left'; clientId: number }
  | { type: 'doc-update'; size: number; origin: 'local' | 'wire' | 'bc' };
```

**Internal helper:**

```typescript
function createSyncEventBus(): {
  emit(event: SyncEvent): void;
  events(filter?: {
  types?: SyncEvent['type'][];
  bufferSize?: number;  // default 256; on overflow, drop oldest
  }): AsyncIterableIterator<SyncEvent>;
};
```

**Wire-in/out events are emitted only when at least one iterator subscribes to them** (cheap to compute; avoids allocating Uint8Array slices when nobody's watching). Other event types are always synthesized because they're already computed for the existing callbacks.

### A4: GOODBYE Wire Frame

**Protocol addition (`packages/sync/src/protocol.ts`):**

```typescript
export const MESSAGE_TYPE = {
  // ... existing 0, 1, 2, 3, 100, 101 ...
  GOODBYE: 102,
} as const;

export const GOODBYE_REASON = {
  UNKNOWN: 0,
  USER_REQUEST: 1,        // goOffline()
  DOC_DESTROYED: 2,       // ydoc.destroy()
  TOKEN_REFRESH: 3,       // reserved for future use
} as const;

export type GoodbyeReason = (typeof GOODBYE_REASON)[keyof typeof GOODBYE_REASON];

export function encodeGoodbye(reason: GoodbyeReason): Uint8Array {
  return encoding.encode((encoder) => {
    encoding.writeVarUint(encoder, MESSAGE_TYPE.GOODBYE);
    encoding.writeVarUint(encoder, reason);
  });
}

export function decodeGoodbye(decoder: decoding.Decoder): GoodbyeReason;
```

**Client wire flow:**

```
goOffline() called
   │
   ├── send(encodeGoodbye(USER_REQUEST))
   ├── ws.close(1000)
   ├── cycleController.abort()
   └── status -> 'offline'

doc.destroy() fired
   │
   ├── send(encodeGoodbye(DOC_DESTROYED))
   ├── masterController.abort()
   └── (existing teardown path)
```

**Server reaction (`apps/api/src/sync-handlers.ts`):**

```typescript
case MESSAGE_TYPE.GOODBYE: {
  const reason = decodeGoodbye(decoder);
  return { action: 'goodbye', reason };  // new action type
}
```

`BaseSyncRoom.webSocketMessage` handles `'goodbye'` by:
1. Logging the reason for telemetry.
2. Marking the connection as `gracefulClose=true`.
3. Replying `RpcError.PeerGone({ deviceId })` to any in-flight RPCs from this peer (instead of letting them time out OR returning `PeerOffline`).
4. Broadcasting peer departure to other peers' awareness immediately (via `removeAwarenessStates` on this peer's `controlledClientIds`).

`RpcError.PeerGone` is a new variant in `packages/sync/src/rpc-errors.ts`. Distinguishes "intentional disconnect" from "we don't know where they went."

```

**Three message types over BC for leader/follower coordination:**

```typescript
// Existing channel: 'yjs:${ydoc.guid}'  (carries doc updates)
// New channel:     'epicenter:sync:${ydoc.guid}'  (carries control messages)

type LeaderMessage =
  | { type: 'leader-status'; status: SyncStatus }       // leader -> all followers
  | { type: 'follower-rpc-request'; rpc: RpcRequest }   // follower -> leader
  | { type: 'follower-rpc-response'; rpc: RpcResponse } // leader -> requesting follower
  | { type: 'follower-awareness'; state: unknown };     // follower -> leader
```

**Public config addition:**

```typescript
export type SyncAttachmentConfig = {
  // Existing config...
  crossTab?: 'auto' | 'direct';
};
```

`crossTab: 'auto'` is the default. In browsers with `navigator.locks` and `BroadcastChannel`, `attachSync` elects one leader tab per document and routes follower work through that leader. In Node, workers, tests without browser globals, and unsupported browser shells, `'auto'` falls back to a direct WebSocket. `crossTab: 'direct'` forces today's one-attachment-one-socket behavior.

**Implementation file: `packages/workspace/src/document/leader.ts` (new)**

```typescript
export function runWithLeaderElection(
  ydoc: Y.Doc,
  config: SyncAttachmentConfig,
  runLeader: (ctx: LeaderContext) => Promise<void>,
): SyncAttachment;
```

`runLeader` is the existing supervisor-machine setup. `runWithLeaderElection` decides at construction whether to launch the supervisor (won the lock), attach BC listeners only (queued), or fall back to a direct socket because cross-tab primitives are unavailable.

**Follower's `SyncAttachment.rpc()`** sends the request as a `follower-rpc-request` BC message; leader picks it up, dispatches as if it came from the wire, sends the response back as `follower-rpc-response`. The follower's pending request map keys by the same `requestId`. Leader rotation does NOT survive in-flight RPCs (followers see `RpcError.LeaderRotated` and re-issue).

**Follower's `peers()` and `find()`** read from a follower-local awareness mirror that the leader keeps populated via the existing BC update stream. They lag the leader by one BC tick.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: A4 - GOODBYE wire frame (smallest, lowest risk, lands first)

- [ ] **1.1** Add `MESSAGE_TYPE.GOODBYE = 102`, `GOODBYE_REASON`, `encodeGoodbye`, `decodeGoodbye` to `packages/sync/src/protocol.ts`.
- [ ] **1.2** Add `RpcError.PeerGone({ deviceId })` to `packages/sync/src/rpc-errors.ts`.
- [ ] **1.3** Wire client send: `send(encodeGoodbye(USER_REQUEST))` in `goOffline()` before `cycleController.abort()` (`attach-sync.ts:958`); `send(encodeGoodbye(DOC_DESTROYED))` in destroy handler before `masterController.abort()` (`attach-sync.ts:990`).
- [ ] **1.4** Server: handle `MESSAGE_TYPE.GOODBYE` in `applyMessage` (`apps/api/src/sync-handlers.ts:243`), return new `{ action: 'goodbye', reason }`. `BaseSyncRoom.webSocketMessage` handles `'goodbye'` by reverse-iterating any in-flight forwarded RPCs whose `requesterClientId` is in this WS's `controlledClientIds`, replying `PeerGone`.
- [ ] **1.5** Tests: client-side, assert `ws.sent` contains a GOODBYE frame before `ws.close` in goOffline/destroy paths. Server-side, drive a fake WS through GOODBYE then assert in-flight RPC replies switched from `PeerOffline` to `PeerGone`.

### Phase 2: A1 - State machine extraction

- [ ] **2.1** Create `packages/workspace/src/document/sync-machine.ts` with `MachineState`, `MachineEvent`, `MachineEffect`, and `step(state, event): { state, effects }`. Pure module; no `Y.Doc`, no `WebSocket` imports.
- [ ] **2.2** Exhaustive reducer test file `sync-machine.test.ts`: every `(state, event)` pair, asserting both next state and effects list. Target: 100% branch coverage.
- [ ] **2.3** Create `packages/workspace/src/document/sync-runtime.ts`. Owns `AbortController` hierarchy, `setTimeout`/`setInterval`, WebSocket factory (or `globalThis.WebSocket` for testability), `getToken` invocation, `backoff` helper. Translates events from the wire/timers into `step()` calls; executes returned effects.
- [ ] **2.4** Refactor `attach-sync.ts`: replace `runLoop`, `attemptConnection`, `ensureSupervisor`, `goOffline`, `reconnect` with calls into the runtime. Keep the public `SyncAttachment` surface byte-identical (`whenConnected`, `status`, `onStatusChange`, `goOffline`, `reconnect`, `whenDisposed`, `rpc`, `peers`, `find`, `observe`, `raw` unchanged).
- [ ] **2.5** Verify all existing `attach-sync.test.ts` tests pass without modification. If a test needed a code change to pass, the public API regressed.
- [ ] **2.6** Delete `permanentFailure` flag (now `state.phase === 'failed'`); delete `currentSupervisorPromise` (now owned by runtime); delete the "reconnect-during-tail" race comment block (impossible by construction now).

### Phase 3: A2 - Automatic browser cross-tab sync

- [ ] **3.1** Add `crossTab?: 'auto' | 'direct'` to `SyncAttachmentConfig`, defaulting to `'auto'`.
- [ ] **3.2** Detect `navigator.locks` and `BroadcastChannel` availability. If either is absent, `'auto'` falls back to direct connection without warning. Missing primitives are normal in Node and test environments.
- [ ] **3.3** Create `packages/workspace/src/document/leader.ts` with `runWithLeaderElection(ydoc, config, runLeader)`. Acquires `epicenter:sync:${ydoc.guid}`. Inside callback, calls `runLeader(ctx)` which builds the supervisor machine + runtime as a leader.
- [ ] **3.4** Define `LeaderMessage` BC channel `epicenter:sync:${ydoc.guid}`. New `attachLeaderChannel` helper that wraps a `BroadcastChannel` and exposes `send(msg)` / `subscribe(handler)`.
- [ ] **3.5** Leader-side: on connected status change, broadcast `leader-status`. On follower-rpc-request receipt, dispatch via the wire as if it were local; on response, broadcast `follower-rpc-response` keyed by request id.
- [ ] **3.6** Follower-side: build a stub `SyncAttachment` whose `status` mirrors `leader-status` BC messages, whose `rpc()` round-trips through BC to leader, whose `peers()`/`find()`/`observe()` mirror leader's broadcast peer set. Leader rotation rejects in-flight follower RPCs with `RpcError.LeaderRotated`.
- [ ] **3.7** Browser app migration: remove explicit `attachBroadcastChannel(doc.ydoc)` calls from workspace modules that also call `attachSync` for the same doc. Keep standalone BroadcastChannel attachments for local-only docs with no `attachSync`.
- [ ] **3.8** Tests: simulate two `attachSync` calls in the same process with shared mock `BroadcastChannel` and shared mock `navigator.locks`; assert exactly one opens a WebSocket; assert follower's `rpc()` reaches the wire via leader; assert leader death promotes follower.

### Deferred: A3 - Public async iterator events API

- [ ] Define `SyncEvent` discriminated union in `packages/workspace/src/document/sync-event.ts`.
- [ ] Add private `createSyncEventBus()` helper: subscribers `Set`, per-subscriber queue, `iterator.next()` resolves from queue or pending Promise, `iterator.return()` drops subscriber.
- [ ] Use the bus in runtime tests where ordered event assertions replace ad hoc queues.
- [ ] Do not add `events(filter)` to `SyncAttachment` until a real app or CLI needs it.

## Edge Cases

### A1: state machine

**Reconnect during handshake.** The current code handles this via the `cycleController` swap + the post-finally `ensureSupervisor` chain (`attach-sync.ts:944-955`). In the FSM model: `STOP{reason:reconnect}` event in `handshaking` state transitions to `connecting`, with effects `[CLOSE_WS, OPEN_WS]`. The `WS_CLOSE` event from the old socket arrives in `connecting` state and is dropped (no-op transition). No race; one event at a time.

**`getToken()` resolves after `STOP`.** The runtime's `GET_TOKEN` effect captures the cycle generation. When the Promise resolves, runtime checks if the generation matches; if not, the result is dropped before being fed back into `step()`.

### A3: internal event bus

**Slow consumer.** Default `bufferSize` is 256. On overflow, drop oldest. Document this clearly. Don't try to do "pause the wire on overflow" - the wire is real-time, not flow-controllable.

**Iterator created but never consumed.** Subscriber registered eagerly; queue grows. After `bufferSize` events, oldest dropped. No memory leak. (Could add a "GC after 60s of no `next()` calls" but that's premature.)

**`for await` with synchronous `break`.** Iterator's `return()` is called automatically; subscriber removed. Verified by private event-bus tests.

### A4: GOODBYE frame

**Server already sent close 4401 before client sends GOODBYE.** GOODBYE arrives at a CLOSING socket; `send()` no-ops (current behaviour at `attach-sync.ts:599-602`). No harm.

**Client sends GOODBYE then network drops mid-flight.** Server may or may not receive it. Server defaults to "PeerOffline" on missed RPC if no GOODBYE was seen. Idempotent - if GOODBYE arrived, optimization fires; if not, fallback path.

### A2: leader election

**Lock acquired but WS auth fails (4401).** Leader transitions to `failed` state. Followers see `leader-status` carrying `failed`. Followers do NOT re-attempt to acquire the lock (the auth failure is a property of the user's session, not the tab; same token, same result). Lock is RELEASED so a future `reconnect()` from any tab can re-acquire and try again.

**Two tabs race for the lock at startup.** Web Locks API guarantees serial acquisition; one wins, others queue. No race.

**Leader navigates away while connected.** Lock auto-released on `pagehide`. Next-in-queue tab's callback fires, opens its own WebSocket. Brief gap (one new STEP1+STEP2 round trip, ~100ms typically). Document this is by-design - leader handoff cost = one handshake.

**Follower issues an RPC; leader rotates mid-flight.** Follower sees `LeaderRotated` and re-issues automatically? Or returns the error to caller? Open question; default to surfacing the error (caller decides whether to retry).

**Same `deviceId` across tabs (current bug).** With leader election, only the leader's awareness state is on the wire. The deviceId appears once, not N times. Fixes a symptom of the current architecture.

**`crossTab: 'auto'` in Node.** No `navigator.locks` and usually no `BroadcastChannel`. Falls back to direct connection per 3.2. CLI tools and servers always go direct; this matches the SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md "server-to-server" pattern.

**Caller already attached BroadcastChannel.** During migration, a caller may still call `attachBroadcastChannel(doc.ydoc)` before `attachSync`. This is CRDT-safe but wasteful. Phase 3.7 removes those calls where the same doc also has `attachSync`.

## Open Questions

1. **Should A1 use a tagged-union state library like `ts-pattern` for `step()`?**
   - Options: (a) plain `switch(state.phase)` + `switch(event.type)`, (b) `ts-pattern` for exhaustive matching with compile-time check, (c) a tiny inline matcher.
   - **Recommendation**: (a) plain `switch`. The reducer is the single place that needs exhaustiveness; TypeScript's `never` check catches missed cases. A library would be the only `ts-pattern` usage in the repo.

2. **Should A3 become public now?**
   - Options: (a) keep event bus private, (b) expose `sync.events()` with status-only events, (c) expose full wire/debug events.
   - **Recommendation**: (a). Status-only duplicates `onStatusChange`; full wire/debug events freeze internals. Build the bus privately first and expose only after a real consumer proves the shape.

3. **A4: should GOODBYE be ack'd by the server before `ws.close()`?**
   - Currently the design sends GOODBYE and immediately closes; server may or may not get it before the FIN.
   - Options: (a) fire-and-forget (proposed), (b) await a server `'goodbye-ack'` text frame before closing, with a 200ms timeout.
   - **Recommendation**: (a). The GOODBYE is an optimization, not a correctness primitive. A 200ms delay on `goOffline()` is bad UX. If the server misses it, fallback (PeerOffline + 30s awareness TTL) is fine.

4. **A2: should browser cross-tab sharing be the default?**
   - Options: (a) default `'auto'` in browsers with fallback to direct, (b) opt-in `leaderElection: true`, (c) direct sockets forever.
   - **Recommendation**: (a). The caller should not know that sync needs leader election plus BroadcastChannel. `crossTab: 'direct'` is enough escape hatch for tests and unusual transports.

5. **A2: what happens to `attachBroadcastChannel`?**
   - It remains available for local-only docs that do not call `attachSync`.
   - For docs that do call `attachSync`, browser BroadcastChannel wiring moves inside sync.
   - **Recommendation**: migrate browser workspace docs away from explicit `attachBroadcastChannel(doc.ydoc)` when the same doc also has `attachSync`.

6. **Should the runtime in A1 expose a `dryRun` mode for testing?**
   - Options: (a) tests stub `globalThis.WebSocket` (current pattern from `attach-sync.test.ts`), (b) runtime accepts a `transport` injection point, (c) both.
   - **Recommendation**: (a). The existing `FakeWebSocket` pattern works; adding a transport seam is pure overhead until we have a non-WebSocket transport.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Three product phases land as separate PRs (A4 first, then A1, then A2). A3 stays private unless a consumer appears.
- [ ] Existing `attach-sync.test.ts` passes byte-identical after Phase 2 (no API regressions).
- [ ] New per-phase tests cover the new surfaces:
  - [ ] Phase 1: GOODBYE frame round-trip + PeerGone on in-flight RPCs.
  - [ ] Phase 2: 100% branch coverage of `step()`; runtime integration test exercises full connect/disconnect/reconnect cycle.
  - [ ] Phase 3: shared mocked `navigator.locks` + `BroadcastChannel` test proves N tabs = 1 WebSocket; leader rotation works.
  - [ ] Deferred A3: private event iterator yields expected sequence; `return()` cleanup; multiple iterators are independent.
- [ ] `bun run check` and `bun run typecheck` pass at every phase boundary.
- [ ] Bundle size delta measured per phase. Goal: net under +12KB min+gz across all four (A1 might be slightly negative, A2 is the bulk).
- [ ] `SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md` updated to describe the FSM, GOODBYE semantics, automatic browser cross-tab sync, and private event-bus testing hooks.
- [ ] No new runtime dependencies added to any package.

### Patterns to follow

- `packages/workspace/src/document/attach-sync.test.ts` - `FakeWebSocket` pattern; reuse for runtime tests.
- `packages/workspace/src/document/attach-awareness.ts` - typed wrapper pattern; A3's iterator helper can mirror its lifecycle discipline.
- `packages/sync/src/protocol.ts:427-451` - SYNC_STATUS codec; GOODBYE follows the same shape.
- `apps/api/src/base-sync-room.ts:340-380` - existing message-action router; GOODBYE adds one new branch.

### Reference implementations consulted

- `yjs/y-websocket` (`WebsocketProvider`): reconnect + ping pattern, no FSM, no leader election. Considered upstream baseline.
- `yjs/y-protocols` (`PROTOCOL.md`): standard SYNC + AWARENESS framing; confirmed our extension IDs (100+) are conflict-free.
- `lib0/broadcastchannel`: y-websocket's cross-tab implementation; reviewed for leader-election patterns (it's flat fanout, no leader).
- `y-sweet`: SYNC_STATUS echo pattern (server is dumb); already in our codebase, validates A4's "server doesn't ack GOODBYE" choice.

### Out of scope (deferred)

- B1 from the original analysis: snapshot+delta replication. Touches server-side persistence; separate spec.
- B2: WebTransport over HTTP/3. Cloudflare DO support is incomplete.
- B3: multi-provider RPC racing. Doc-level concern, not supervisor-level.
- B4: Lamport-based "saved" tracker. Violates "server is a dumb echoer" invariant.
