/**
 * Walk up the filesystem from `start` (default `process.cwd()`) until we
 * hit the first directory that contains `epicenter.config.ts` or a
 * `.epicenter/` directory. That directory is the project root.
 *
 * This is the canonical way to mint a `ProjectDir`: every other consumer
 * (daemon path helpers, script factories, `connectDaemon`) accepts
 * `ProjectDir` so the brand acts as proof that the path was discovered via
 * this function and points at a real vault root. Plain `string` paths
 * (e.g., `process.cwd()`) won't satisfy `ProjectDir` without an explicit
 * cast.
 *
 * Used by `connectDaemon` and per-app `script.ts` factories so vault
 * scripts don't have to pass `projectDir` explicitly: running a script from
 * anywhere inside the vault tree resolves the same daemon socket the
 * surrounding `epicenter up` is bound to.
 *
 * Throws if no marker is found before reaching the filesystem root.
 * Catching is deliberate: callers that want a "run anywhere, cold-sync
 * from cloud" mode pass an explicit `projectDir` (typically `process.cwd()`)
 * to opt out of the throw.
 *
 * @param start Where to begin walking up. Defaults to `process.cwd()` so
 *   the caller's invocation directory drives discovery.
 * @returns The project root, branded as `ProjectDir`.
 * @throws If no `epicenter.config.ts` or `.epicenter/` is found before the
 *   filesystem root.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // From inside a vault script:
 * const projectDir = findEpicenterDir();
 * // '/Users/braden/Code/my-vault' as ProjectDir
 *
 * // Explicit start (e.g. resolving from a known config path):
 * findEpicenterDir(path.dirname(configPath));
 * ```
