/**
 * Stable Yjs `clientID` derivation for ephemeral peers.
 *
 * Yjs assigns a random 53-bit `clientID` to each `Y.Doc` and retains every
 * mutation it produces in the StructStore for the life of the document.
 * Naive ephemeral peers (vault scripts launched per invocation) would mint
 * a fresh random clientID per process, leaving one StructStore entry per
 * invocation in the daemon's state vector.
 *
 * `hashClientId(path)` derives a stable 53-bit positive integer from a
 * string identity (typically `Bun.main`). Two invocations of the same
 * script reuse the same clientID; their writes merge under Yjs causality.
 * The state vector grows with the count of distinct scripts that mutate,
 * not the count of invocations.
 *
 * Output range: `[1, 2^53 - 1]`. Zero is reserved by Yjs for "no peer";
 * we shift by one to keep the contract clean. Collisions are
 * astronomically unlikely on a single-machine peer population.
