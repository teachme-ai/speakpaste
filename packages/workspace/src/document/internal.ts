/**
 * Internal subpath — not part of `@epicenter/workspace`'s public API.
 *
 * Exports the `create*` factories that wrap a pre-constructed `ObservableKvStore`.
 * External consumers should use `attachTable` / `attachKv` from the package
 * root — those are the public Y.Doc-wiring entry points.
 *
 * The encrypted attachments in this same package reach in here because they
 * construct their own encrypted store and need the factory logic without the
 * Y.Doc wiring.
 * Awareness has no analogous encrypted path, so there's no reason to export
 * `createAwareness` here.
