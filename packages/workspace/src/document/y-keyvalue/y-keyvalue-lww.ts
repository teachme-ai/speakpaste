/**
 * # YKeyValueLww - Last-Write-Wins Key-Value Store for Yjs
 *
 * A timestamp-based variant of YKeyValue that uses last-write-wins (LWW) conflict
 * resolution instead of positional ordering.
 *
 * **See also**: `y-keyvalue.ts` for the simpler positional (rightmost-wins) version.
 *
 * ## When to Use This vs YKeyValue
 *
 * | Scenario | Use `YKeyValue` | Use `YKeyValueLww` |
 * |----------|-----------------|-------------------|
 * | Real-time collab | Yes | Either |
 * | Offline-first, multi-device | No | Yes |
 * | Clock sync unreliable | Yes | No |
 * | Need "latest edit wins" | No | Yes |
 *
 * ## How It Works
 *
 * Each entry stores a timestamp alongside the key and value:
 *
 * ```
 * { key: 'user-1', val: { name: 'Alice' }, ts: 1706200000000 }
 * ```
 *
 * When conflicts occur (two clients set the same key while offline), the entry
 * with the **higher timestamp wins**. This gives intuitive "last write wins"
 * semantics.
 *
 * ```
 * Client A (2:00pm): { key: 'x', val: 'A', ts: 1706200400000 }
 * Client B (3:00pm): { key: 'x', val: 'B', ts: 1706204000000 }
 *
 * After sync: B wins (higher timestamp), regardless of sync order
 * ```
 *
 * ## Timestamp Generation
 *
 * Uses a monotonic clock that guarantees:
 * - Local writes always have increasing timestamps (no same-millisecond collisions)
 * - Clock regression is handled (ignores backward jumps)
 * - Cross-device convergence by adopting higher timestamps from synced entries
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Simplified logic:
 * const now = Date.now();
 * this.lastTimestamp = now > this.lastTimestamp ? now : this.lastTimestamp + 1;
 * return this.lastTimestamp;
 * ```
 *
 * Tracks the maximum timestamp from both local writes and remote synced entries.
 * Devices with slow clocks "catch up" after syncing, preventing their writes from
 * losing to stale timestamps.
 *
 * ## Tiebreaker
 *
 * When timestamps are equal (rare - requires synchronized clocks AND coincidental
 * timing), falls back to positional ordering (rightmost wins). This is deterministic
 * because Yjs's CRDT merge produces consistent ordering based on clientID.
 *
 * ## Storage Complexity
 *
 * With `gc:true` (the default), storage is `O(active data) + O(unique devices)`.
 * Deleted entries, overwritten values, and edit history are garbage collected into
 * compact GC structs. A store with 20 active keys stays at roughly the same size
 * whether it was created yesterday or has processed 52,000 operations. The only
 * additional overhead is ~22 bytes per unique Yjs clientID that has ever written
 * to the doc. With `gc:false`, this property breaks—storage grows with operation
 * count. See `docs/articles/yjs-storage-efficiency/storage-scales-with-data-not-history.md`.
 *
 * ## Performance Architecture: Single vs Bulk Operations
 *
 * This class exposes two pairs of write methods:
 *
 * | Operation | Single-row | Bulk |
 * |-----------|------------|------|
 * | Insert/update | `set()` | `bulkSet()` |
 * | Delete | `delete()` | `bulkDelete()` |
 *
 * Both pairs produce identical results. The difference is internal:
 *
 * **`set()` eagerly cleans up the old entry** before pushing the new one.
 * It calls `deleteEntryByKey()` which scans the Y.Array (O(n)) to find and
 * remove the old entry. The observer then sees a clean add—no conflicts. This
 * is fast for individual calls but O(n²) when called 10K times in a loop,
 * because each call re-scans the (mutating) array.
 *
 * **`bulkSet()` defers cleanup to the observer.** It pushes all entries without
 * deleting old ones, then the observer fires once, builds an entry→index Map from
 * one `toArray()` call, and resolves all conflicts with O(1) Map lookups. Total:
 * O(n) instead of O(n²). The observer's cleanup deletion uses `DEDUP_ORIGIN` to
 * prevent a re-entrant observer call (which would be a no-op anyway).
 *
 * **`delete()` eagerly scans** to find and remove one entry. Same O(n) as `set()`.
 *
 * **`bulkDelete()` scans once** to collect all matching indices, then batch-deletes
 * right-to-left. Unlike `bulkSet`, it does NOT defer anything to the observer—
 * deletions happen directly, no DEDUP_ORIGIN needed.
 *
 * ```
 * Single ops (fine for individual use, O(n²) in a loop):
 *   set():    deleteEntryByKey O(n) + push O(1) → observer: no conflicts
 *   delete(): deleteEntryByKey O(n)              → observer: processes deletion
 *
 * Bulk ops:
 *   bulkSet():    push × N + observer resolves all via Map   [DEDUP_ORIGIN]
 *   bulkDelete(): scan once + batch delete right-to-left     [no DEDUP_ORIGIN]
 * ```
 *
 * ## Real-World Bottlenecks (Measured)
 *
 * The cost profile is NOT what Big-O suggests. `toArray()` is ~0.04ms even at
 * 25K entries—negligible. The actual bottleneck is `Y.Array.delete(index)`, which
 * walks Yjs's internal linked list. This cost scales non-linearly within large
 * transactions due to structural fragmentation:
 *
 * - **For `bulkDelete`**: Deleting 25K items in one transaction is ~3x slower than
 *   chunking into groups of 2500. The Yjs linked-list walk compounds when many
 *   deletes happen in a single transaction.
 * - **For `bulkSet`**: Inserting 25K items in one call forces the observer to build
 *   one massive entryIndexMap. Chunking into groups of 1000 is ~10x faster.
 *
 * Because of this, the `Table` layer (in `create-table.ts`) wraps these
 * methods with chunked async loops. The optimal chunk sizes differ:
 * - `bulkSet`: 1000 (observer conflict resolution is the bottleneck)
 * - `bulkDelete`: 2500 (Yjs linked-list deletion is the bottleneck)
 *
 * The observer's conflict resolution logic is shared with multi-device sync—when
 * two clients set the same key while offline, the observer resolves that conflict
 * using the same entryIndexMap and DEDUP_ORIGIN path that `bulkSet` uses.
 *
 * ## Limitations
 *
 * - Future clock dominance: If a device's clock is far in the future, its writes dominate
 *   indefinitely. All devices adopt the highest timestamp seen, so writes won't catch up
 *   until wall-clock reaches that point. Rare with NTP, but be aware in environments with
 *   unreliable time sync.
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import * as Y from 'yjs';
 * import { YKeyValueLww } from './y-keyvalue-lww';
 *
 * const doc = new Y.Doc();
 * const yarray = doc.getArray<{ key: string; val: any; ts: number }>('data');
 * const kv = new YKeyValueLww(yarray);
 *
 * kv.set('user1', { name: 'Alice' });  // ts auto-generated
 * kv.get('user1');  // { name: 'Alice' }
 * ```

/**
 * Transaction origin that marks observer cleanup deletions as "internal."
 *
 * ## When this fires
 *
 * The observer resolves LWW conflicts by keeping the winner and deleting losers.
 * That deletion happens in a nested `doc.transact()`. Without this origin, the
 * nested transaction would trigger the observer AGAIN — but the re-entrant call
 * is always a no-op:
 * - `_map` already points to the winner (updated in the first observer pass)
 * - Reference equality `_map.get(key) === loserEntry` fails → nothing happens
 * - No change events emitted
 *
 * Marking the transaction with DEDUP_ORIGIN lets the observer skip the re-entrant
 * call entirely (`if (transaction.origin === DEDUP_ORIGIN) return`).
 *
 * ## What triggers conflicts
 *
 * 1. `bulkSet()` — pushes entries without deleting old ones, observer resolves
 * 2. Multi-device sync — two clients set the same key offline, observer resolves
 * 3. Constructor initial dedup — runs before observer is registered, doesn't need this
 *
 * Note: `set()` eagerly deletes via `deleteEntryByKey` so the observer sees no
 * conflicts. `delete()` and `bulkDelete()` only remove entries — no conflicts.
 * DEDUP_ORIGIN is only relevant for the conflict-resolution path.
 *
 * Follows the same pattern as REENCRYPT_ORIGIN in the encrypted wrapper.

	/**
	 * Set many key-value pairs in one transaction.
	 *
	 * Unlike {@link set}, this intentionally skips `deleteEntryByKey()` for existing
	 * keys. Instead, all entries are pushed to the Y.Array, and the observer resolves
	 * duplicate-key conflicts in a single pass when the transaction ends.
	 *
	 * ## Why this is faster than calling `set()` in a loop
	 *
	 * `set()` calls `deleteEntryByKey()` per key — an O(n) array scan. In a loop:
	 * N calls × O(n) scan = O(n²). `bulkSet` defers all cleanup to the observer,
	 * which builds an `entryIndexMap` (Map<Entry, index>) from one `toArray()` call
	 * and resolves each conflict with an O(1) Map lookup. Total: O(n).
	 *
	 * The observer's conflict resolution already exists for multi-device sync — when
	 * two clients set the same key offline. `bulkSet` reuses that exact same path.
	 *
	 * ## When to use
	 *
	 * - Importing 1K+ rows: `ykv.bulkSet(entries)` in a transaction
	 * - For chunked imports with progress, use `Table.bulkSet()` which wraps
	 *   this method with chunking, `onProgress`, and event-loop yielding
	 * - For < 100 rows, `set()` in a `doc.transact()` is simpler and equivalent
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```typescript
	 * ykv.bulkSet([
	 *   { key: 'row-1', val: { title: 'First' } },
	 *   { key: 'row-2', val: { title: 'Second' } },
	 * ]);
	 * ```

	/**
	 * Delete many keys in one scan plus one batched transaction.
	 *
	 * Unlike calling {@link delete} in a loop (which scans the array per call —
	 * O(n²) for N deletions), this collects all matching entry indices in a single
	 * `toArray()` scan, then deletes them right-to-left so indices stay stable.
	 *
	 * ## How this differs from `bulkSet`
	 *
	 * `bulkSet` defers cleanup to the observer (which triggers a second, skipped
	 * observer call via DEDUP_ORIGIN). `bulkDelete` does NOT defer anything — it
	 * performs the deletions directly in one transaction. The observer fires once,
	 * sees the deletions, and updates `_map`. No conflicts, no DEDUP_ORIGIN needed.
	 *
	 * Note: despite what Big-O analysis might suggest, the `toArray()` scan is NOT
	 * the bottleneck (~0.04ms at 25K entries). The real cost is the `yarray.delete()`
	 * calls inside the transaction—each one walks Yjs's internal linked list. This is
	 * why the `Table` layer chunks calls to this method rather than passing all
	 * IDs at once (large single transactions are slower due to linked-list fragmentation).
	 *
	 * ## Why right-to-left?
	 *
	 * Deleting at index 9000 doesn't change the position of index 50. By processing
	 * indices in descending order, all pre-computed indices remain valid throughout
	 * the batch. No re-scanning needed.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```typescript
	 * ykv.bulkDelete(['key-1', 'key-2', 'key-3']);
	 * ```
