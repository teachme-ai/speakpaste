/**
 * attachEncryption — per-ydoc encryption coordinator.
 *
 * A workspace owns several `EncryptedYKeyValueLww` stores (one per table plus
 * the KV store). This attachment coordinates key application across all of
 * them: it derives a per-workspace HKDF keyring from base64 user keys and
 * calls `activateEncryption(keyring)` on every registered store in lockstep.
 *
 * ## Method-on-coordinator pattern
 *
 * The coordinator owns the method surface for attaching its sibling
 * primitives. Instead of top-level `attachEncryptedTable(ydoc, encryption, ...)`
 * exports, call the methods on the returned attachment:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const encryption = attachEncryption(ydoc);
 * const tables = encryption.attachTables(ydoc, defs);
 * const kv = encryption.attachKv(ydoc, defs);
 * ```
 *
 * The method names deliberately mirror the plaintext primitives
 * (`attachTable`, `attachTables`, `attachKv`) so the pattern reads
 * symmetrically — "encryption's attach-tables" vs "plain attach-tables."
 *
 * ## Registration model
 *
 * Each method creates the backing `EncryptedYKeyValueLww` store, registers it
 * with the coordinator, and returns the typed helper. The coordinator holds
 * the list and applies the current keyring (if any) to each new registrant
 * immediately — so registering after `applyKeys` has run does not leave the
 * store plaintext.
 *
 * ## Fingerprint dedup
 *
 * Auth token refreshes fire `onLogin` repeatedly with identical key material.
 * The attachment holds a `lastKeysFingerprint` so subsequent calls with the
 * same keys short-circuit before HKDF and per-store activation run. The
 * fingerprint is order-independent — reversed key arrays produce the same
 * fingerprint (see `encryptionKeysFingerprint`).
 *
 * ## Disposal
 *
 * The attachment registers a single `ydoc.on('destroy')` listener that
 * disposes every registered store and resolves `whenDisposed`. Callers tear
 * down encryption by calling `ydoc.destroy()` — the attachment does not
 * expose a standalone `dispose()` method.
 *
 * ## What this attachment does NOT do
 *
 * - It does not wipe CRDT state. Any future "wipe encrypted blobs" API needs
 *   to coordinate with persistence to be useful — design it alongside the
 *   consumer migration.
 * - It does not validate that every encryption-capable slot on the Y.Doc
 *   got registered. The caller owns the composition — if you pair a
 *   plaintext `attachTable` with `encryption.attachTable` targeting the
 *   *same slot name*, Yjs hands both calls the same underlying `Y.Array` and
 *   you get a silent plaintext-over-ciphertext race. The verb
 *   (`encryption.attachTable` vs plain `attachTable`) is the primary defense;
 *   review call sites accordingly. One slot name, one attach site, one intent.
 *
 * ## Why `workspaceId` is read from `ydoc.guid`
 *
 * By construction, the workspace Y.Doc's `guid` equals the workspace id
 * (`new Y.Doc({ guid: id })`). Taking a separate `workspaceId` parameter
 * would invite drift between the two. `deriveWorkspaceKey` uses the id as
 * an HKDF domain-separation label — it doesn't care whether the string is
 * the guid or an explicit id, only that the two agree.
