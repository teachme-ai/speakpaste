/**
 * Read-only hydrator for an `attachYjsLog` file.
 *
 * Opens a file the writer (`attachYjsLog`) owns, replays every
 * `updates` row into the Y.Doc once, and stops there: no `updateV2`
 * listener, no compaction timer, no writes. The reader's Y.Doc can mutate
 * freely afterwards; mutations stay in memory and never flow back to disk.
 *
 * Use case: script-side mirror of a daemon's Yjs log file (the
 * daemon-as-materializer-worker design at
 * `specs/20260429T235500-daemon-as-materializer-worker.md`).
 *
 * Missing files are a no-op: `fileExisted` is `false` with no replay
 * (the Y.Doc stays empty) so the caller falls through to cloud sync.
 * The writer is expected to have set WAL on the file so concurrent
 * readers get snapshot pages without `SQLITE_BUSY`.
 *
 * Construction is synchronous: `existsSync` + open + replay all run on
 * the calling tick. The Y.Doc is fully hydrated by the time this
 * function returns; no `whenLoaded` field.
